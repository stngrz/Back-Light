# Back-Light
I am a motorcycle enthusiast and love riding despite being hit by a car a few years ago. I continue to ride but am more cuatious and am constantly seeking ways increase awareness and visibilty to actually be safer on the road.

Having rebuilt a '84 Pointiac Firebird at age 15 I became quite familiar with the rules and regualtions needed for a vehicle to be street legal. One stand out difference from my car and those that came later was the requirement for a elevated centered break light, something none exixtant and not required for motorcycles. This Back Light light deck as im currently calling it is my current solution to this. A back or helment mounted light deck with flashers, break lights and blinkers. 

I am documenting and displaying progress for my Back Light project. A small LED assembly to signal slowing and turning to be worn on your person when traveling on roads or other high traffic areas. For motor and pedal bikes alike.

Contains a few mp4 documenting progress on v2.
